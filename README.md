MirandaCallerIdPlugin
=====================

An old plugin I wrote for Miranda IM to provide caller ID capabilities when the computer is connected to a landline through a modem

Basic caller ID functionality for Miranda. Notifies using a notification baloon next to Miranda's systray icon. Also able to save a call log.

This plugin can also use the Relay plugin to notify you if you're away from home and someone calls in.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Windows 2000 or later is required. DO NOT install this plugin if you don't have Windows 2000 or later! 

Note the requirements section before installing the plugin.
